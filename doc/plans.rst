With debianize present, we should probably rename the {source,binary} package.

Naming-wise, perhaps it should include the fact that these tools are vcs-only
and perhaps something about them drafting/assisting with packaging rather than
taking all of it.

Ideas:

 * deb-vcs-tools
 * autodeb
 * package-assist
 * package-drafter
