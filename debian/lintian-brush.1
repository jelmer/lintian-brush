.SH SYNOPSIS
lintian\-brush [\-h] [\-\-no\-update\-changelog] [\-\-version] [\-\-list-fixers] [\-\-list-tags\] [\-\-diff\] [TAGS [TAGS ...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
lintian-brush automatically applies a set of fixes for common lintian issues,
adds the relevant changelog entries and commits the changes to the local
version control system.
.PP
The tool's philosophy is to fix any issues for which it knows a correct fix,
and to back off if it does not.
.IP

.TP
TAGS
Lintian tag for which to apply fixers.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-update\-changelog\fR
Whether to update the changelog.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-fixers\fR
List available fixers.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-tags\fR
List lintian tags for which fixers are available.
.TP
\fB\-\-fixers\-dir\fR DIRECTORY
Override the fixers directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-diff\fR
After running all fixers, display the changes made as a single unified diff.
.TP
\fB\-\-modern\fR
Use features that require packages that are not yet available in Debian stable.
.TP
\fB\-\-identity\fR
Print the identity (name and e\-mailaddress) that lintian-brush will use when committing changes, and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-net\-access\fR
Do not attempt to use the network to e.g. retrieve additional package metadata from hosting sites, or to check whether a homepage is also available over HTTPS.
.TP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Run fixers but do not actually make changes to the repository. Useful in particular in combination with \-\-diff.
.IP
Note that this currently will create a temporary clone of the repository, which may be slow for large repositories.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be more verbose. For example, print list of fixers that was run and print tracebacks for failed fixers.
.TP
\fB\-\-uncertain\fR, \fB--yolo\fR
Make changes with lower certain than normal. This will potentially fix more
issues, but is more likely to get things wrong. If changes with lower certainty were made,
lintian-brush will let you know in its output.
.TP
\fB\-\-allow\-reformatting\fR
Allow reformatting of files that are being changed, so long as this does not
affect the semantics. This could mean stripping whitespace, but in some cases
could also mean stripping comments.

.SH WRITING AND DEBUGGING FIXERS
Fixer scripts for lintian-brush can be found under \fI/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers\fR.
.PP
Lintian-brush normally takes care of making sure that the working tree doesn't
contain any pending changes, of reverting changes when a fixer fails and of committing the
changes and updating debian/changelog if necessary.
.PP
However, for testing purposes, you can also run the scripts directly in a
packaging repository. See /usr/share/doc/lintian-brush/README.md.gz (section
"Writing new fixers") for details about the expected behaviour from fixer scripts.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBDEB_UPDATE_CHANGELOG\fR
Used to control whether the changelog should be updated, depending on whether
it is set to "leave", "update" or "auto". The --update-changelog and --no-update-changelog arguments
override this.
.TP
\fBDEB_COMPAT_RELEASE\fR
Oldest Debian release to stay compatible with.
.TP
\fBUDD_URL\fR
postgresql connection string to use to connect to UDD. Defaults to the public
UDD mirror; see https://udd-mirror.debian.net/ for details.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "\fB$ lintian-brush\fR --list-tags"
List all lintian tags for which fixers are available.
.IP "\fB$ lintian-brush\fR"
