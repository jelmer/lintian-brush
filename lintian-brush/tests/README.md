This directory contains simple tests for lintian-brush fixers.

The subdirectories are named after specific fixers.

For each fixer, there are a number of subdirectories, one for each test.

Per test, a number of files and directories can exist:

 * in/: directory with package contents to run on
 * out/: directory with package contents after fixer has run
 * message: Expected output generated by fixer (optional for no-op)
 * env: File with =-separated key/value pairs of environment variables to set (optional)

If the test verifies that the fixer does not take any action, then "out" can be a
symlink to "in" and the message file is optional.
