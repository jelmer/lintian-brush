# This is a comment, and the next line is empty

# The next line should be unaffected:
foo source: some-tag another exact match
foo source: some-tag wildcard * match

# This is an example override that only applies to the i386
# architecture.
foo [i386] binary: some-tag optional-extra

# An architecture wildcard would look like:
foo [any-i386] binary: another-tag optional-extra

# Negation also works
foo [!amd64 !i386] binary: some-random-tag optional-extra

# Negation even works for wildcards
foo [!any-i386] binary: some-tag-not-for-i386 optional-extra

# The package name and the package type is optional, so this
# also works
[linux-any]: tag-only-for-linux optional-extra.

# This line will be rewritten:
debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature
