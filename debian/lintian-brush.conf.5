.nf
\fBupdate-changelog\fP = \fITrue|False\fP
.fi

The \fBupdate-changelog\fP setting determines whether new lines in the changelog

such as checking for the presence of a \fB[gbp]\fR section in \fIdebian/gbp.conf\fP)

You may want to set this to \fIFalse\fR if you are using "gbp dch" to generate
your changelog entries.
