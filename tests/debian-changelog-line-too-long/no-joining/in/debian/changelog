    - Sort translated choices when a select/multiselect template contains
      a line Listorder: lexicographic
      If some Choices items must not be sorted, they can be prepended with
      an exclamation mark.  Adding a comment is a good idea to let
      translators know why this sign has been put here:
        _Choices: ${FOO}, !Other[ You only have to translate Other, remove the exclamation mark and this comment between brackets]
      Currently text, newt, slang and gtk frontends support this feature.
