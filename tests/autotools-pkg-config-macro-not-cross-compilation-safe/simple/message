Use cross-build compatible macro for finding pkg-config.

The package uses AC_PATH_PROG to discover the location of pkg-config(1). This
macro fails to select the correct version to support cross-compilation.

This patch changes it to use PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG macro from pkg.m4.

Refer to https://bugs.debian.org/884798 for details.
