.. _writing-fixers:

Writing new fixers
------------------

Each fixer is a simple script that lives under ``fixers``. Scripts should
be registered in the ``index.desc`` file in the same directory.

A fixer is run in the root directory of a package, where it can make changes
it deems necessary. If a fixer can not provide any improvements, it can simply
leave the working tree untouched - lintian-brush will not create any commits for it
or update the changelog. If exits with a non-zero return code, whatever changes
it has made will be discarded and the fixer will be reported as having failed.

The following additional environment variables are set:

 * ``PACKAGE``: The name of the source package that is being edited.
 * ``CURRENT_VERSION``: Package version that is being edited.
 * ``COMPAT_RELEASE``: Debian release to be compatible with. Usually ``sid``
   when --modern was specified and the name of the current stable release otherwise.
 * ``NET_ACCESS``: Whether the fixer is allowed to make network connections
   (e.g. sending HTTP requests). Used by --disable-net-access and the testsuite.
   Set to either ``allow`` or ``disallow``.
 * ``OPINIONATED``: Set to ``yes`` or ``no``. If ``no``, fixers are not expected
   to make changes in which there is no obvious single correct fix.

A fixer should write a short description of the changes it has made to standard
out; this will be used for the commit message.

It can include optional metadata in its output::

 * ``Fixed-Lintian-Tags:`` followed by a comma-separated list of lintian tags
   that it claims to have fixed. This will make lintian-brush include
   links to documentation about the fixed lintian tags. In the future,
   it may also support building the package to verify the lintian tag
   is actually resolved.

 * ``Certainty:`` followed by ``certain``, ``confident``, ``likely`` or
   ``possible``, indicating how certain the fixer is that the fix was the right
   one.

The easiest way to test fixers is to create a skeleton *in* and *out* source tree under
``tests/FIXER-NAME/TEST-NAME``. The ``in`` directory should contain the tree to
run the fixer on,and ``out`` contains the directory after it has run. It's fine
to create directories with only one or two control files, if the fixer only
needs those.
