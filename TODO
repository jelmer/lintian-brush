- Tests
- Error out when accidentally running on generated files (e.g. look for "DO NOT EDIT")
- Support running in non-vcs-controlled packages? How?
- Be a little bit more clever about editing control files; perhaps use python with debian.deb822 rather than sed?
- Preserve whitespace formatting when changing control fields; needs debian.deb822 hackery
- Support different certainty fixers
- Improve changelog descriptions
- Skip fixers for lintian tags that have overrides?
- Support preserving wrap-and-sort formatting
